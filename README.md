# GLAM Logit: A random-utility-consistent method to estimate non-parametric coefficents from ubiquitous datasets

### 1 Introduction

Group Level Agent-based Mixed (GLAM) Logit is a variation of mixed logit (MXL) model, which provides deterministic and individual-specific estimation that can be efficiently integrated into optimization models.
